# POLYMORPHISM

## ONLINE BANKING SYSTEM
The project simulates a basic banking system where different types of accounts perform transactions (deposit and withdraw).

### WITH PRINCIPLE
Easily add more account types without modifying existing code. Avoids repetitive if-else conditions, keeping logic clean. Each subclass handles its own behavior.

### WITHOUT PRINCIPLE
Adding new account types requires modifying withdraw and deposit methods. The same conditions are repeated multiple times, making it harder to maintain. We need to modify existing methods to add new behavior.
